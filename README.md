Acknowledgement 
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Zidio Development for providing me with this internship opportunity. 
My heartfelt thanks to my mentor Smruti Priya mam and my team members for their constant guidance, valuable 
feedback, and motivation throughout this journey. Their support helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of 
full-stack development and enterprise-level application architecture, and their encouragement motivated me to 
overcome challenges during the project development. 
Introduction 
The internship program at Zidio Development was designed to provide hands-on experience in real-world software 
development. My assigned project was ZidioConnect – Job Management Web Portal, a platform aimed at bridging 
the gap between job seekers and recruiters through a secure, scalable, and user-friendly interface. 
The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a full-stack application using: 
 Backend: Spring Boot (Java 21), REST APIs, Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate 
 Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS 
 Database: MySQL 8.0 
During this internship, I primarily focused on backend development, as there were no frontend development classes conducted 
in our group. This allowed me to gain deep expertise in backend technologies, while also exploring and implementing some 
frontend features independently. 
 RESTful API development and design 
 Role-based authentication and JWT token security 
 Database modeling and optimization 
 Integration with external services (payment gateways, cloud storage, email) 
This internship provided a platform to practically apply theoretical knowledge from my MCA program in a real
world environment, enhancing both my technical and soft skills.
